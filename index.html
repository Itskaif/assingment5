                            <p>Noakhali, a coastal district in southeastern Bangladesh, is prone to flooding due to its
                                geographical location and low-lying terrain. The district is crisscrossed by several
                                rivers,
                                such as the Meghna, which often overflow during the monsoon season, exacerbated by heavy
                                rainfall and tidal surges from the Bay of Bengal. Flooding in Noakhali results in
                                widespread
                                inundation of farmlands, homes, and infrastructure, leading to displacement of
                                residents,
                                loss of crops, and disruption of livelihoods. The situation is often worsened by poor
                                drainage systems and rising sea levels linked to climate change. During severe floods,
                                emergency services struggle to provide aid, and many areas become isolated, further
                                complicating relief efforts. Despite these challenges, the people of Noakhali show
                                resilience, rebuilding their lives in the aftermath of frequent floods.</p>

                            <p>The Feni district, located in southeastern Bangladesh, is frequently affected by flooding
                                due
                                to its low-lying topography and monsoon rains. Heavy downpours, often exacerbated by the
                                overflow of local rivers such as the Feni River, lead to widespread inundation,
                                impacting
                                both urban and rural areas. The flooding disrupts daily life, damaging homes,
                                infrastructure, and agricultural lands, which are vital to the local economy. Displaced
                                families face significant challenges, including loss of livelihoods and access to clean
                                water and sanitation. Community resilience is tested as locals come together to assist
                                one
                                another in recovery efforts. Despite the recurrent nature of these floods, the people of
                                Feni demonstrate remarkable strength and solidarity in rebuilding their lives and
                                infrastructure in the aftermath.</p>

                            <p>The Quota Reform Movement, or "Quota Andolon," in Bangladesh began in 2018 as a protest
                                against the public service quota system. Many students and job seekers argued that the
                                existing quotas, which reserved positions for specific groups like freedom fighters’
                                children and women, were being misused, leading to unfair advantages.Protests erupted
                                across
                                universities, with activists demanding a reduction in quotas and a shift toward
                                merit-based
                                recruitment. The movement brought attention to issues of social equity and access to
                                opportunities in the job market. Although the government has made some adjustments to
                                the
                                quota system, the Quota Andolon continues to raise important discussions about fairness
                                and
                                transparency in recruitment practices in Bangladesh.</p>
